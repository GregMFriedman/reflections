Diff allowed me to filter out things that were the same

Easy access to old versions means you can take more risks
Manual Commits make your versions more intentional

Git log lets you see all changes & times
Git diff lets you see exact changes & color codes it
Version control means that you can always undo anything stupid
I want to use Git to learn Javascript
